    <li> <b>How does Sniper work? </b> You fill out the <a href="/"> form on the homepage.</a> Sniper checks the Rutgers Schedule of Classes to see if your class is open every 15 minutes and emails you if it is open. </li>
    <br>
    <li> <b> Can Sniper automatically register me for my class if it opens up. </b> Nope it cannot do this for you. It will, however, send you a Webreg link that makes it very easy to register for it, once you're notified. </li>
    <br>
    <li> <b>Sniper did not email me when my class opened up</b> Sniper checks for classes to be open every 15 minutes. If a class opens up for shorter than 15 minutes, there's a chance that Sniper will never know that it's open. </li>
    <br>
    <li> <b> Why check every 15 minutes and not more frequently? All my lizard classmates are glued to their computers and are checking to see if Orgo Lab is open 15 times a second. </b> If you're checking webreg more frequently than 15 minutes, Sniper is not for you. Running sniper uses up resources on my server, and I think 15 minutes of a time interval is reasonable enough to check for class openings. If you strongly believe that checking more frequently is necessary, let me remind you that <a href="http://github.com/v/sniper"> Sniper is open source </a>. </li>
    <br>
    <li> <b> Why does Sniper not watch classes on the Newark/Camden campus or for Winter/Summer semesters? </b> I do not have a great deal of time to spend on developing Sniper. <a href="http://github.com/v/sniper"> Sniper is Open Source </a>. If you feel strongly about adding support for Newark/Camden or for other terms, feel free to make these changes yourself and submit a pull request. </b> </li>

    <li> <b> Why does Sniper no longer send text messages? </b> Sniper is funded by my own wallet. It doesn't cost much to run except for the cost of sending SMS. It costs $0.0075 to send an SMS. If I'm sending out 10,000 messages a week, that's $75 out of a college kid's wallet. Emails are far cheaper to send ($1 / 10,0000 emails). If you think Sniper is good piece of software, you should ask the administration/registrat to support it. If you *really* want text message alerts, you can always enter your <a href="http://www.emailtextmessages.com/"> carrier email address </a> into Sniper. </li>
    <br>
    <li> <b> How do I know Sniper is working? </b> Sniper is meant to be a fire-and-forget application, where you don't need to worry about checking Webreg over and over. If you want to confirm that it's working, you can input a section of a class that's already open (640:024:01 is pretty much always open). You should receive an email from sniper in 15 minutes. </li>
    <br>
    <li> <b> I didn't get into my class after Sniper notified me. Please keep looking for it. </b> Whenever Sniper notifies you, it will also email you a link that you can click to keep sniping the class. </li>
    <br>
    <li> <b> I already got into my class. Stop the notifications please! </b> Sniper is written in such a way  that once it notifies you about a section of a class, it forgets that you were ever watching that section. It will only ever notify you about a section of a class once, unless you decide to snipe the class again. If you are receiving notifications for one class multiple times, please send me email (address in the footer). </li>
    <br>
    <li> <b> I think there's a bug with sniper. </b> Please send me an email (my email address is in the footer). If you are a developer, you can check out the source code of Sniper and also send me a pull request. </li>
